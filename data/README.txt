README

The files in this folder are related to the Zebrafish Seurat tutorial.

zdata.matrix.txt:
 Contains an expression matrix for the Zebrafish dataset. Rows are genes and columns are expression matrices. Expression values represent the number of random molecular tags sequenced for each gene, normalized to a total of 20,000 RMT per cell. We also removed uncharacterized and poorly annotated genes (SI, ORF, etc.) as described in the manuscript.

Rmd:
 Contains R markdown files (and precomputed PDF outputs) for each tutorial stage

output_part1.Robj, output_part2.Robj, output_part3.Robj:
 Each stage of the tutorial saves and outputs an Robj file saving the Robj that is produced. These files can be generated by running the tutorial in order, but precomputed versions are included here for convenience (for example, the tutorial can be started from Part 4 since the output_part3.Robj is loaded at the beginning).

Spatial_ReferenceMap.xlsx:
 Binarized in-situ patterns used in the manuscript, scoring a gene as ‘off’ or ‘on’ in each of 64 bins.
